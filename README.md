## HTML Assessment

##Overview
A simple .html doc to demonstrate basics of html.
Includes a paragraph, list, table, and input areas. (Though the input areas are attractive, they are not yet functional.) I took the liberty of including some humor, changed the sports teams, and added a little to the sports team's list of info.

##Technology Used
Atom to create the .html -- Chrome & Safari to display the completed .html -- lorem ipsum generator 'bacon', WW3 Schools, Codeacademy, Seahawks & Panthers websites.

##Lessons Learned
basic html is fairly functional and easy to create, holding out for css to dress it up
