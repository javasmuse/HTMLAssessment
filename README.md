## HTML Assessment

### Overview

A simple .html doc to demonstrate basics of html.
Includes a paragraph, list, table, and input areas. (Though the input areas are attractive, they are not yet functional.) I took the liberty of including some humor, changed the sports teams, and added a little to the sports team's list of info.

Also, in same project, added a CSS document and standardized (for the entire class) matching html document.

### Technology Used

Atom to create the .html -- Chrome & Safari to display the completed .html -- lorem ipsum generator 'bacon', WW3 Schools, Codecademy, Seahawks & Panthers websites.
Atom to creat the .css - Chrome & Safari to display the completed .html & .css. Git to handle the files.

### Lessons Learned

basic html is fairly functional and easy to create, holding out for css to dress it up.

CSS works well for dressing up the html.
